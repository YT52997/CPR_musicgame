# CPR_musicgame

## Introduction
This project is one of the work in Makereal Labs, NYCU.
We aim to build a concrete and clear process for learnig CPR, especially for students under senior high school.
The first game is a tempo game to help people practice the bpm of CPR which is between 100-120 bpm everytime and everywhere.
The second game is a QA game to build the right knowledge of CPR.
The last game is for class and test of CPR, which provides teachers a tool to clearly determine the ability for a student to do CPR.
